0x1C. C - Makefiles

This repository contains my solutions to the projects and tasks of the 0x1C. C - Makefiles curriculum at Holberton School.

Description

In this curriculum, I learned about Makefiles, a build automation tool used to compile and manage large projects. Makefiles are essential in C programming for efficiently compiling source code, managing dependencies, and organizing project structure.

The projects and tasks in this curriculum cover various topics related to Makefiles, including:

- Understanding the basic structure and syntax of Makefiles
- Defining rules and dependencies
- Compiling and linking multiple source files
- Managing object files and executable targets
- Cleaning and removing temporary files
- Using variables, flags, and macros in Makefiles
- Creating and managing complex projects with multiple directories
